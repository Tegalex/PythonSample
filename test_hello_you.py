# First, create a variable called start, and set it equal to "I am ".
# Remember the space after the word "am" !
start = "I am "

# Next, create a variable called age and set it equal to your age in years.
# This must be a number
age = 20

# Next, create a variable called end, and set it equal to " years old".
# Remember the space before the word "years"
end = " years old"

# Next, create a variable called output and use {} symbols and the format() function to stick the start, age and end variables
# together to make a string.
output = "{}{}{}".format (start,age,end)
# An example output string would be "I am 15 years old"


# Finally, print the output to the screen using the print() function.
